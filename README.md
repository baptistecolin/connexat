simple graph-theory related Java program, with GUI

At Mines ParisTech, there is a Java software development course during the first year. For some students, this is the first time that they are confronted to software development. After being taught Java, our grade is based on the development of a basic Java program that must feature a GUI.
I chosed to do something graph-theory related : my program enables you to draw a graph using your mouse, and can compute its connectivity.
In `rapport.pdf`, you will find an extensive description of my work (written in French)
